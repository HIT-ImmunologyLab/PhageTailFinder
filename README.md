## Introudction
PhageTailFinders is an effective tool to predict phage tail protein based on hidden Markov model. The reliability of this tool has been tested, and the results have good accuracy and low error rate. At the same time, compared with other tools, the prediction speed of this tool is faster and the effect is better.The standalone version of the whole tool is built and good visualization results are provided. The Python program combining multiple steps is also concentrated in a script file, which is convenient for users to use the multi-phage batch prediction provided in the tool.
